Hi, my name is Kryštof and I am 17 years old student from Prague, the Czech Republic. Welcome to my digital portfolio!

Once, a good friend of mine told me that I was like a social butterfly. It was at a party of one conference and while everyone was getting drunk, I was talking with people and networking a bit. A week after, I was selected as one of the coordinators of the European Youth Parliament Czech Republic. The week after I also googled the term, "social butterfly" and got align with it. It fits me greatly, I love people, yet, I like not to waste time with them; I am a typical ENTJ, efficiency is the language of my life.

If you would ask me what the goal of my life is, my answer would be simple: to find something that fits me and succeed in it! Be active, never expect anything from people around you, be independent, always challenge me and never stop learning.
