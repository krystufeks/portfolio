Born in Prague, the heart of Europe, I got the possibility to travel around and to experience new coulters since a very young age. I was raised in a tolerant, liberal catholic family and when I lived in Prague I was known to be one of the most pro-active students.

When I was growing up, I experienced working as a volunteer with disabled people, organizing conferences and leading students with the European Youth Parliament (EYP) and working as a finance coordinator for an NGO but also engaging myself in different LGBTI and HateFree organizations. Now, my high-school carrier is almost over and I am trying to figure out how to use my experiences and the things that I am so motivated for in my professional life.

If you would ask me what the goal of my life is, my answer would be simple: to find something that fits me and succeed in it! Be active, never expect anything, be independent, always challenge myself and never stop learning.

At the moment you can find me living and learning in the mountains of Peru, in Cusco. I am here finishing my IB Diploma, thanks to the Think Global School.
