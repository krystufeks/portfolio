For almost two years, I have been volunteering as a scout leader in a local Scout organization in Prague. As a leader, my responsibility was to design and conduct an educational, active and fun program for young kids and youth. It was an important step in becoming an adult - taking responsibility for kids and for their leisure activities education. I was a scout leader for the whole time I was living in Prague, and even now I am from time to time volunteering for them to help with organization or to share my knowledge.
