Asistence o.p.s. (o.p.s. is a Czech abbreviation for a Public Service Company) It is a provider of social services for more than 250 people with physical and multiple disabilities in Prague. Namely personal assistance, support the transition from school to the next life (i.e., The transit program), job search (supported employment). We have a long-term active in removing barriers from public transport.

I became a volunteer in  2013, with the primary motivation to become a personal assistant. However, that was not possible because the law only allows personal assistants to be over 18 years old. So I joined a group of people making afternoon programme for some of the clients of the Company (we called it Club), where I planned many excursions, speakers visits, Club's original theatre live performance. I helped to solve many naturally rising issues and long-term cooperated on what the Club initiated.

After nine months, I quit due to the study reasons and because I also got a stable place at the European Youth Parliament. However, I am still a member of the community of volunteers, under Asistence o.p.s., and occasionally, I am co-organizing big events, or helping with marches, etc.
