The European Youth Parliament (EYP) is a unique educational programme which brings together young people from all over Europe to discuss current topics in a parliamentary setting.  As a network of independent associations, EYP is present in 39 European countries and organises almost 500 events every year. The EYP network organises almost 1.000 days of EYP activity every year, involving close to 28.000 participants. Thousands of young people are active as volunteers all over Europe, making EYP a programme truly for young people, by young people.

I joined the EYP at the age of 15 starting with a small conference in my home country. Since then I have been in the media team and I have vice presided, organized, and chaired. For two years already, I am working as a member of the Finance government for my National Committee - the EYP Czech Republic.
