### Stockholm International Film Festival
Volunteer - Photographer (November 2015)
The Stockholm International Film Festival (abbr. SFF) (Swedish: Stockholms filmfestival) is an annual film festival held in Stockholm. It was launched in 1990 and has been held every year in the second half of November. Since its start, the festival has focused on bringing forth and supporting new talents through competitions and scholarships. The Film Festival is organized by a group of young people who are working for the Festival, yet the overall body is mostly formed by volunteers from all over the world. Between people working behind the stage, preparing organizational stuff, fundraising and doing all needed is a group of selected photographers, which I had the possibility to join.
