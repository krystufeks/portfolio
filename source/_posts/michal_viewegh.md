Michal Viewegh (1962) studied Czech Language and Literature and Pedagogy at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague. He taught briefly at the Elementary school in Zbraslav. In 1993 he became an editor of the Československý spisovatel publishing house. In 1995 he became a full time writer and soon after that also the best-selling Czech contemporary author. He writes social novels and parodic prose, his style is characterized
by postmodern methods. He is a great storyteller who likes to combine comic and tragic moments, quotes, relativizes things and sees his characters from different points of view. A number of his books have already been made into films: Bringing Up Girls in Bohemia, The Wonderful Years of Lousy Living, A Women’s Novel, The Sightseers, Shameless, The Case of Unfaithful Klara, A Men’s Novel, Angels of the Everyday, Dodgeball. In 2012 he underwent surgery for aortic dissection, a surgery nine out of ten patients do not survive. He returned to this experience in his twenty-fifth book, My Life After Life (2013).


##### A message Michal wrote to us:

Cyril does not deny being indulgent,
he calls himself a gourmet;
morover, he readily admits
being somewhat
finicky but in the same breath
he adds that it is only a
kind of reparation
for socialism, for all those
dreadful meals he had to eat
in school and university canteens,
pubs of third and fourth price range
and various snack bars.
