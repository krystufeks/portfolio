### Life happens now



When we are procrastinating we can not make ourselves able to fulfil commitments; we end up doing unnecessary things, instead of doing something really meaningful. According to the Oxford Dictionary, procrastination means a delay in completing an action, while for many scientists procrastination can mean the pathological postponement.

The behaviour has always been a feature of human beings for ages as it can be proved by word's Latin origin. One of the first writers and thinkers tackling the issue was Seneca, a Roman Stoic philosopher. In his speeches, he was mainly focusing on time and its management. This was a very uncommon subject in Ancient Rome since only the richest had the opportunity to lose time. In comparison, nowadays, more than 80% of people procrastinate every day. This number came from a big joint survey of Ivy League universities, where they questioned more than five thousand people. Plus, the surveyors admitted that the number is probably even higher because of the bad introspection people have. So let's admit it, everyone procrastinates.

Even though it is clear that people were procrastinating since the dawn of ages, it has never been such a problem as it is now. In the last century, people have grown up during the war, and  their main target was not achieving 1000 friends on Facebook, their main target was to survive. The world we live in is just playing into procrastinations patterns. Therefore, it is one of the most important skills for today's population to learn how to fight it.

The possibilities and potential we have today are, compare to the world few years ago, truly unbelievable. We can imagine the width of it as a huge splayed scissors, which are being more and more open, with the new possibilities the world is giving us. More we can do, more freedom we have, the merriest we get. So then, why researchers are showing that the world's happiness is decreasing? For instance, just the number of depression has increased of ten times in last thirty years.

Moreover, the increasing rate of decision-making paralysis is causing procrastination. Postponement of those decisions makes everything even worse. Both by it and because of it, we are then losing time we could have invest into doing something valuable that we want to do and we feel dedicated to. If you learn how to beat procrastination, you can do much more and you can fully use the potential of your life.

Procrastination happens to us because of patterns hidden in our brain and neurological system and the evolution of our brain is the place we need to study. In the beginning, the most developed hemisphere was the right, controlling emotions and feelings. With the progress of evolution, the left side of the brain developed, giving more importance to the rational part, also having the power to plan things and to tell the body what to do. Unfortunately, the right brain is older and more extended, so it often happens that even though we command ourselves something, the emotional brain takes the lead.

Controlling procrastination requests a lot of self-discipline, self-regulation and self-control. The easiest way how to actually get ourselves to do something is mainly about decreasing the emotional averse we feel towards the work we need to do. Doing this, we do not let the emotional part of our brain take rule over what we do and the method itself is called the rider and the elephant.

Last but not least, only without procrastination, you can feel the dopamine, the hormone of happiness, circulating in your body. Before you snooze your alarm tomorrow morning, just think about the aftermath of procrastination; before you postpone something more important, try to implement the elephant method, and understand that time is too precious to get wasted.
