All This Belongs To Me received the Magnesia Litera award for the “book debut”, Plastic Three-bedroom Apartment was awarded the Jiří Orten Prize and the novel Taiga Station got the Josef Škvorecký Prize. Klára Kubíčková described  her controversial novel Macocha in iDNES as a “grandiose literary experience”, Petr. A. Bílek in Respekt as the most successful novel Hůlová has written so far, and Josef Chuchma in Orientace LN as a fall to the bottom of the literary cesspit.

##### A message Petra wrote to us:

You can fuck your way into a culture;
actually, nowhere it can be easier
than where “soft” skills predominate
over the “hard” ones which can be
expressed in numbers. It is said that
you cannot do that with art; however,
the competitive environment is all
the harder as everybody is a bit of
an artist, whereas not everybody can
calculate square roots, which can also
be easily proven, whereas the quality
of experimental prose cannot.
Petra Hůlová (an excerpt
from Macocha, pp. 65)
