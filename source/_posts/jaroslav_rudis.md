##### A message Jan wrote to us:

Mrs. Mašínová dies on 12th June
1956 in the Pankrác Prison hospital
ward, the same place where Borek’s
neck was broken the year before. In
the end, Pankrác will swallow both
Emma’s children; it is like a riddle,
born in the same house
died in the same house
but it wasn’t the same house.
