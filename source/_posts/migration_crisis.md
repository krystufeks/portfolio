European migration crisis, a slogan that is filling headlines of all the newspapers since the beginning of the year, yet, even more in the last few months. The Europe we know today has been historically shaped by migration. Yet, in 2014 an alarming 59.5 million people were displaced around the world. According to the UN Refugee Agency, more than 51% of the displaced people were relocated to Europe. This great influx of refugees was mostly triggered by the situation in the Middle East, Ukraine, the Mediterranean-African area and Eritrea. The European economic situation, not yet fully rehabilitated from the EURO crisis faces a new economic challenge - ensure a future for millions of people crossing its borders.

Not since the WWII have so many people been uprooted against their will but this time they are trying to get into Germany and not out. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel firstly argued that Germany obviously has geographical limitations and its economic resources are depletable and thus it cannot accept all the incoming asylum seekers. Yet, her opinion drastically changed after a group of neo-Nazi attacked one of the asylum shelters near Berlin. Since then, Germany opened its borders to all the immigrants and it expects the number of immigrants in 2015 grow up to 800 000. Just in January 2016, the number of people crossing German borders has been estimated to 130 000, German Federal Minister of the Interior, Thomas de Maizière, has said, another important player, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, said that the country can accept 500 000 refugees annually in the next few years. "Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here." - slogan that was used during many pro-refugees demonstrations, mainly around Germany but also elsewhere around Europe. After the European leaders rejected the proposal to apply refugee quotas, that would help to redistribute the asylum seekers that are because of the Dublin III Regulation system stuck mainly in Italy, Greece and Hungary. Germany decided to take a different approach; instead of playing the role of the European economic dictator it turned itself into a European moral leader.

Germany believes that this is the way to, firstly, decrease the generally high level of EU xenophobia, and secondly, to make the EU accept a common stance and take action. Angela Merkel keeps trying to pass the quota and it seems that some action could be finally taken, in the meantime accepting refugees is still in order for German dynamic economy and its aging population to some extent the economy will profit from the situation. A few days ago, the UK prime minister announced that his country will accept 20 000 refugees and the USA announced that they will accept up to 10 000 refugees. Although those two numbers are not high - same as Germany accepts in 3 days - it is a significant step forward for European solidarity, which is one of the main German priorities. It is clear that while three years ago, Barroso said that federal Europe will be ‘a reality in a few years’, today no one would say the same; Germany believes that the European Union’s future is dependent on tackling with the current migration crisis and that this is a big challenge for today’s Europe and for today’s world. To sum up; German stand is to, firstly, redesign the EU asylum policy, secondly, to reform the Dublin III Criteria, thirdly, to ensure that the EU, bound to accept refugees seeking international protection by the Geneva Convention and the EU Qualification Directive, does it, and finally, to further encourage the European integrity and solidarity.
