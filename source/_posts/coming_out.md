## Highlighting the impact homophobia can have on an individual
###### The story is based in London

Nicki Minaj’s latest song is on high in my earphones, and in the best part of it I suddenly cannot hear anything. The train is coming. "Please mind the gap between the train and the platform”,- that is the only thing I catch over the sound of the song. People exit, and I enter. Usually when I am in the underground, I observe people around me, evaluate their appearance, and try to imagine what their lives might be like. Yet today, the only thing I can do is to try not to think about anything.

The first stop is behind me, and the train continues towards Marble Arch.

I play the song again from the start. And while Nicki Minaj is rapping, my mind keeps on reminding me of today’s morning when I was still in Oxford. Just a few hours ago, I was walking down the Queen Street with an old friend of mine. We were talking about an Oxford University college I could potentially apply to, when two boys passed by. They were holding each other's hands. My friend abruptly interrupted my passionate tirade on whether Magdalen College is better than Trinity College, and started talking about what is natural and who has the right to hold someone’s hand, while eyeing the unfortunate couple. I was a frail and instead of expressing how I felt, I told my friend that I don’t feel well and left with the first train back to London. Perhaps it just recalled in me a feeling from the years of unacceptance and loneliness I grew up with, or maybe I am so used to gay-friendly people that I forgot how many of them are actually still as close minded as they were always. So on the train back, I did yet another provocative thing - I came out on Facebook by writing a ‘profound’ status about gay people being humans and how that is beautiful.

“Marble Arch. Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.”, - voice with a clear London accent interrupts my meditation.

Next station I need to get out. My friend, Daniel, is probably already waiting there, in his favorite corner, of our dearest St Christopher's Place, drinking a coffee and reading a book. Imagining him sitting there alone gives me another few minutes of a thought-free mind; this time fully focused on what is about to come. When I am conscious again, I am jumping into the warmest hug in the world, into his big hands that he protectively puts around me. With his eyebrows up and smile on he takes my hand and looks at it and then at me. I follow his eyes and there on my right hand is with small neat handwriting written “I am gay, I am human”.

I laugh and explain to him what happened today and I know that on our way to the vibrant Soho he will listen to everything I need to say.
